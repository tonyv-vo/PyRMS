This app was made alongside Group 53's Restaurant Ordering and Food Delivery system that was made with ASP.NET Core. This particular version was not finished since the views and models are not entirely connected, and there was no API endpoints made for this app.

However, this app was used to generate the SQL queries for the final report.

To run this app:

```
git clone https://github.com/tonyv-vo/PyRMS.git
cd PyRMS
python3 -m venv venv
.\venv\bin\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```

To access the flask shell inside the virtual environment:

```
flask shell
```
